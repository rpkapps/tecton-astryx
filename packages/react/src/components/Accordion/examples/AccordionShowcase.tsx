 * Rows inside one card, coordinated so only one is open at a time.
 *
 * Triggers take body-semibold rather than the trigger's default `large`: three
 * rows sharing a single surface are peers, and at 17px semibold each would
 * read as its own section heading. Keep `large` for the case it is for — one
 * Collapsible per card or per Section, where the trigger really is the
 * heading of that surface (see the Multiple Mode and Controlled examples).
